Willpower
=========

Willpower is a Python application builder with a high granularity on components opposed
to other builder tools like `Cookiecutter`_.

Willpower starts a new application project with a project template (using
`Cookiecutter`_) and then build many components (models, admin, views, templates, etc..)
for each defined model declaration.

A model declaration defines the model fields and many options around for the components
such as your model components may include their own options.
